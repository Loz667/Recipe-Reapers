# Untitled Cosy Cooking meets Turn-Based Combat RPG
 A 3D Action-Adventure RPG, with cooking elements and turn-based combat.

 Players will be tasked with collecting food that would normally end up in the pig trough, to satisfy the hunger of marauding beasts throughout the realm, in this unique juxtaposition of genres.

 Based on another original idea, Food for Thought, I wanted to mess with some established game tropes in order to create a new experience for RPG fans and new players alike.
